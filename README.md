## Name and description

**The Developer's Cheatsheet** allows you to post and access cheatsheets to languages, frameworks, and libraries that are community maintained.

## Project Purpose and Goal

As a first medium-sized app, I dove into this development process without any method. One of my first motivations was to build something that could gather all my knowledge so far while practicing the backend basics. A second motivation was having the developer's community in mind.

After some refactoring, I set as goals for this project to have:
- [x] Database integration
- [x] MVC model structure
- [x] Authentication service
- [x] Reset password functionality
- [x] Nodemailer integration to send emails
- [x] CRUD API to index, post, update and destroy cheatsheets
- [x] Testing
- [ ] Views and UI (in progress)
- [ ] Deployment

## Web Stack and Explanation

I picked specifically the NodeJS and Express stack for its simplicity that abstracts a lot of technicalities while I could focus on the decision-process of the app and the basics of building a fully working app.

Through mongoose, the MongoDB database use is smooth while offering the scalability that a NoSQL database has.

## Installation

To run this project in development mode:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Problems and Thought Process

As one does, this app offered me a whole deal of frustration. Taking off the wheels of my bicycle was the first main problem. In the beginning, I wasn't doing a whole lot more than the code I already did on tutorials, but having to do it by myself was a struggle that I had to overcome day by day.

You read a ***lot*** about **clean code** and **reusability online**, but having to code having these principles in mind became a lot trickier. Slowly overcoming this was the **main challenge** of this app. Even if I learned how to use a single piece of technology, chasing these principles is always a ***working-in-progress***.
